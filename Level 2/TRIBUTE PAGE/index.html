                    <b>Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was the youngest son of Debendranath Tagore, a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, which was a new religious sect in nineteenth-century Bengal and which attempted a revival of the ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid down in the Upanishads. He was educated at home; and although at seventeen he was sent to England for formal schooling, he did not finish his studies there. In his mature years, in addition to his many-sided literary activities, he managed the family estates, a project which brought him into close touch with common humanity and increased his interest in social reforms. He also started an experimental school at Shantiniketan where he tried his Upanishadic ideals of education. From time to time he participated in the Indian nationalist movement, though in his own non-sentimental and visionary way; and Gandhi, the political father of modern India, was his devoted friend. Tagore was knighted by the ruling British Government in 1915, but within a few years he resigned the honour as a protest against British policies in India.

                <h3>Tagore’s Famous Work and Contributions</h3>
                <ul>
                    Rabindranath Tagore was a genius, writer, novelist, visual artist, composer, playwright, philosopher and a well-known poet. He had a strong grasp of language when penning poetry or fiction and was a good philosopher who impacted many Indians throughout the independence war. His most well-known work is a collection of beautiful poems called Geetanjali. Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1931 for Geetanjali. His contribution to Indian literature is significant and memorable. Two of his Rabindrasangeet compositions have become national anthems of two countries: “Amar Shonary Bangla” (Bangladesh’s national anthem) and “Jana Gana Mana” (India’s national anthem). Even today, his innovative creations, whether poems or short stories, are unrivalled. He may have been the first to bridge the gap between west and east through his brilliant works.

Puravi was another of his compositions in which he mentioned Evening Songs and Morning Songs under many social, moral, cultural, religious, and political topics. He collected some social and lyrical poetry in Manasi, which he wrote in  1890. The lives of the Bengali people inspired the majority of his works. Another work, Galpaguccha, was a compilation of stories about the Indian people’s poverty, backwardness, and illiteracy. Sonar Tari, Kalpana, Chitra, Naivedya, and other poetry collections and novels include Gora, Chitrangda and Malini, Binodini and Nauka Dubai, Raja and Rani, and others. He was a deeply pious and spiritual man, which aided him greatly during difficult times. As a renowned educator, he established Santiniketan, a unique university dedicated to peace.
